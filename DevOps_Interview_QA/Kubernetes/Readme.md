### **Kubernetes Basics**

1. **What is Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps in managing containers across clusters of machines, handling tasks such as load balancing, scaling, service discovery, and storage management.

2. **What are the key components of a Kubernetes cluster?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A Kubernetes cluster has two main components:
     - **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster (e.g., API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, etcd).
     - **Node/Worker Node**: Where containers run (contains components like Kubelet, Kube Proxy, and container runtime).

3. **What is a pod in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster and can host one or more containers. All containers in a pod share the same network namespace, storage, and lifecycle.

4. **What is the difference between a pod and a container in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A container is an isolated execution environment for applications, while a pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that may contain one or more containers. Pods allow containers within them to share network and storage resources.

### **Kubernetes Architecture**

1. **Can you explain the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A Kubernetes cluster consists of:
     - **Master Node (Control Plane)**: Manages the cluster's state. Key components:
       - **API Server**: Frontend for Kubernetes control plane, handles REST requests.
       - **Scheduler**: Decides on which node to place a pod.
       - **Controller Manager**: Governs controllers like ReplicaSet and Deployment.
       - **etcd**: Consistent key-value store for Kubernetes data.
     - **Worker Node**: Runs application workloads in pods. Components:
       - **Kubelet**: Ensures the containers are running as expected.
       - **Kube Proxy**: Maintains network rules for services.
       - **Container Runtime**: Docker, containerd, or CRI-O for running containers.

2. **What is etcd, and why is it important in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: **etcd** is a distributed key-value store used to store all the cluster data, including configurations, states, and metadata. It is critical for maintaining the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster and ensuring data consistency across the control plane.

3. **What is a namespace in Kubernetes, and why do we use it?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **namespace** is a way to divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. It allows for isolation of resources, such as deployments and services, within the same physical cluster. It’s useful for organizing workloads, especially in multi-tenant environments or large projects.

### **Kubernetes Objects and Resources**

1. **What is a deployment in Kubernetes, and how do you create one?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **Deployment** is a higher-level abstraction for managing sets of replica pods. It ensures that the specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. You can create a deployment using a YAML file or `kubectl`:
     ```bash
     kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_name>
     ```

2. **What is a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **ReplicaSet** ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. It’s typically used by deployments to maintain the desired number of replicas. If pods fail or are deleted, the ReplicaSet automatically creates new pods to meet the desired state.

3. **What is a Service in Kubernetes, and what types of Services are there?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **Service** is a stable endpoint (DNS name) that provides access to a set of pods, enabling load balancing and service discovery. Types of services:
     - **ClusterIP** (default): Exposes the service on an internal IP within the cluster.
     - **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP.
     - **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
     - **ExternalName**: Maps the service to an external DNS name.

4. **What is a StatefulSet, and when would you use it?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **StatefulSet** is used to manage stateful applications that require persistent storage and stable network identities. It is often used for databases and applications where each pod needs a unique identity (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

5. **What is a ConfigMap in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **ConfigMap** is a Kubernetes object used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. It allows you to separate configuration from application code and inject it into pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or files.

6. **What is a Secret in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **Secret** is an object used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, or SSH keys. Secrets are encoded in base64 and can be mounted into containers or passed as environment variables to avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext.

### **Kubernetes Operations**

1. **How do you update a running deployment in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: To update a running deployment, you can use the `kubectl apply -f <deployment_file>.yaml` command or `kubectl set image` to update the image of a specific container. Kubernetes will automatically handle rolling updates to ensure zero downtime:
     ```bash
     kubectl set image deployment/<deployment_name> <container_name>=<new_image>
     ```

2. **How would you scale an application in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: To scale an application, you can use the `kubectl scale` command:
     ```bash
     kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=<number_of_replicas>
     ```

3. **How do you troubleshoot issues in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: To troubleshoot Kubernetes issues:
     1. Check pod logs with `kubectl logs <pod_name>`.
     2. Check pod status with `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` to get detailed information about the pod.
     3. Use `kubectl get events` to identify issues at the cluster level.
     4. Check resource limits and usage with `kubectl top pod`.
     5. For networking issues, check service and ingress configurations.

4. **How do you perform a rolling update in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: Kubernetes performs a rolling update by default when you update a deployment. It will update pods in a controlled manner, ensuring that a specified number of pods are always running. This can be controlled using the `--max-surge` and `--max-unavailable` options. To manually trigger a rolling update, you can use:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f <deployment_file>.yaml
     ```

### **Advanced Kubernetes Concepts**

1. **Explain the concept of Helm and how it helps with Kubernetes deployments.**
   - **Expected Answer**: **Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes, which simplifies deploying and managing applications. It uses **charts** (pre-configured Kubernetes manifests) to define applications and dependencies, making it easy to manage complex applications. Helm charts allow for versioning and reuse of configurations.

2. **What is the role of the Kubernetes Ingress controller?**
   - **Expected Answer**: The **Ingress controller** is responsible for managing inbound traffic to services within a Kubernetes cluster. It uses **Ingress resources** to define HTTP and HTTPS routing rules. The Ingress controller can be backed by **NGINX**, **Traefik**, or a cloud-provider load balancer.

3. **What is the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?**
   - **Expected Answer**: The **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics. It adjusts the number of replicas to ensure the application has the right amount of resources.
     ```bash
     kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment_name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
     ```

4. **What is a DaemonSet in Kubernetes, and when would you use it?**
   - **Expected Answer**: A **DaemonSet** ensures that a copy of a specific pod is running on all (or a subset of) nodes in the cluster. It’s often used for background services like log collectors, monitoring agents (e.g., **Fluentd**, **Prometheus node exporter**), or system daemons that need to run on every node.

5. **What is the concept of "taints" and "tolerations" in Kubernetes?**
   - **Expected Answer**: **Taints** are applied to nodes to repel pods unless those pods have a matching **toleration**. This mechanism is used to ensure that specific pods are scheduled on certain nodes (e.g., specialized hardware or nodes with limited resources). Pods with tolerations can be scheduled on ta

inted nodes.
