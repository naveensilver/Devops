   - **What they're looking for**: Knowledge of cloud migration strategies, including lift-and-shift, re-platforming, or re-architecting. You should discuss challenges like data migration, network setup, security policies, scaling, and handling downtime during migration.

### 10. **What strategies do you use to manage multi-cloud deployments, and how do you avoid vendor lock-in?**
   - **What they're looking for**: Experience with multi-cloud environments, cloud-agnostic architectures, and strategies for managing workloads across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). You should also discuss the use of tools like Kubernetes for abstraction, Terraform for infrastructure management, and the concept of cloud-neutral solutions.

### 11. **Explain how you would design a disaster recovery (DR) plan for a Kubernetes-based application with stateful services.**
   - **What they're looking for**: Your ability to design a DR strategy, considering high availability, backup strategies, multi-region clusters, and handling persistent state (e.g., databases). Mention tools like Velero for backup and restore, StatefulSets for managing stateful apps, and multi-cloud or multi-region clusters for ensuring availability.

### 12. **How do you handle versioning and rollback of infrastructure changes in a DevOps environment?**
   - **What they're looking for**: Experience with version control for infrastructure (e.g., GitOps with tools like ArgoCD or Flux), managing infrastructure changes with tools like Terraform, and defining policies for safe rollbacks. Discuss how to maintain the consistency of the environments across multiple stages (development, staging, production).

### 13. **Describe the process you would use to implement blue-green or canary deployments in Kubernetes.**
   - **What they're looking for**: Familiarity with deployment strategies in Kubernetes, including blue-green and canary deployments. Discuss how Kubernetes resources like deployments, services, ingress controllers, and rollouts can be used to minimize downtime and reduce risk during deployment.

### 14. **How would you optimize cloud cost management in a Kubernetes environment?**
