## Monitoring: You mentioned that you've worked with Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and the ELK Stack. Can you describe how these tools are used in the DevOps pipeline?

- "While I haven't had extensive hands-on experience specifically managing monitoring systems, I understand the importance of monitoring in the DevOps pipeline. I am familiar with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and ELK Stack from reading documentation, collaborating with team members, and observing how these tools are used in production environments. In my current role, I’ve worked with the development team to ensure application logs are properly structured for monitoring purposes and have contributed to setting up alerts and dashboards. I’m eager to deepen my knowledge and hands-on experience with monitoring tools, and I’m confident in my ability to quickly get up to speed given my background in automation and infrastructure management."
