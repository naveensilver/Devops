Here is a comprehensive list of common **Terraform commands** used for managing infrastructure as code. Each command serves a different purpose during the lifecycle of Terraform operations:

### 1. **`terraform init`**
   - **Purpose**: Initializes the working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This command is the first step when working with a new Terraform configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```
   - **What it does**:
     - Downloads necessary provider plugins.
     - Initializes the backend configuration (where Terraform's state is stored).
     - Sets up the working environment.

### 2. **`terraform validate`**
   - **Purpose**: Validates the Terraform configuration files for syntax errors and checks if the configuration is internally consistent.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform validate
     ```
   - **What it does**: It doesn't check if the configuration is valid in the context of your infrastructure, but it ensures the syntax and structure of the files are correct.

### 3. **`terraform plan`**
   - **Purpose**: Creates an execution plan by comparing your current infrastructure state with the configuration in your `.tf` files.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform plan
     ```
   - **What it does**: 
     - Shows what changes Terraform will make (create, update, or destroy resources).
     - It doesn’t apply any changes; it only previews them.
   - **Optional**: You can specify a `-out` option to save the plan for later application:
     ```bash
     terraform plan -out=tfplan
     ```

### 4. **`terraform apply`**
   - **Purpose**: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```
   - **What it does**: 
     - Executes the changes to your infrastructure as defined by the `terraform plan` or directly from the configuration files.
     - After running `terraform plan`, you can apply the plan:
       ```bash
       terraform apply tfplan
       ```
   - **Interactive Prompt**: By default, Terraform will ask for confirmation before applying the changes.

### 5. **`terraform show`**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the current state or a plan in human-readable format.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform show
     ```
   - **What it does**: Outputs the current state or a plan that was generated previously. It helps you review the resources and values in the state file.

### 6. **`terraform state`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides advanced commands to interact with Terraform's state file.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform state list
     terraform state show <resource>
     ```
   - **Common subcommands**:
     - `list`: Lists all the resources in the current state.
     - `show <resource>`: Displays the details of a specific resource from the state.
     - `mv`: Moves resources from one state to another (useful in refactoring).
     - `rm`: Removes a resource from the state.

### 7. **`terraform import`**
   - **Purpose**: Imports existing infrastructure into Terraform's state so it can be managed by Terraform.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
     ```
   - **What it does**: Allows you to bring resources that were manually created or managed outside of Terraform into Terraform's state.

### 8. **`terraform destroy`**
   - **Purpose**: Destroys all resources defined in your Terraform configuration files.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform destroy
     ```
   - **What it does**: Destroys the infrastructure managed by Terraform and removes it from the state.

### 9. **`terraform output`**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the values of output variables from the Terraform state.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform output
     ```
   - **What it does**: Displays the output values, which are often used to get information about created resources (e.g., instance IP address, URLs, etc.).

### 10. **`terraform fmt`**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically formats Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files) according to the standard Terraform style.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform fmt
     ```
   - **What it does**: Cleans up the formatting of the `.tf` files, ensuring consistency and readability.

### 11. **`terraform providers`**
   - **Purpose**: Lists the providers used in the configuration, including the provider plugins.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform providers
     ```
   - **What it does**: Displays all the provider configurations that are required by the configuration files.

### 12. **`terraform taint`**
   - **Purpose**: Manually marks a resource as "tainted," causing Terraform to destroy and recreate it on the next `apply`.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform taint <resource_type>.<resource_name>
     ```
   - **What it does**: Forces the resource to be destroyed and recreated during the next `terraform apply` (useful for forcing a resource to be recreated if it is malfunctioning).

### 13. **`terraform untaint`**
   - **Purpose**: Removes the "tainted" status from a resource.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform untaint <resource_type>.<resource_name>
     ```
   - **What it does**: Reverts the effect of `terraform taint` and prevents a resource from being destroyed and recreated.

### 14. **`terraform version`**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the Terraform version you are currently using.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform version
     ```
   - **What it does**: Prints the installed Terraform version, and the versions of providers used in the configuration.

### 15. **`terraform providers lock`**
   - **Purpose**: Locks the provider versions for the configuration. This command is particularly useful when you want to ensure consistent versions are used for each run.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform providers lock
     ```

### 16. **`terraform console`**
   - **Purpose**: Opens an interactive console for evaluating Terraform expressions.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform console
     ```
   - **What it does**: Allows you to interactively evaluate expressions and data sources in your Terraform configuration, similar to a REPL.

### 17. **`terraform workspace`**
   - **Purpose**: Manages workspaces in Terraform. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) with the same configuration.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     terraform workspace list
     terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
     terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
     ```
   - **What it does**: 
     - `list`: Lists all workspaces.
     - `new`: Creates a new workspace.
     - `select`: Selects an existing workspace to work with.

### Terraform Command Flow Example:

1. **Initialize your working directory**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Create an execution plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the plan to create resources**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Check output values**:
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```

6. **Destroy the resources**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

### Summary:
These are the core commands you’ll need while working with Terraform to manage your infrastructure. Most workflows follow the sequence of `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`, but you’ll also rely on the other commands (like `terraform destroy`, `terraform validate`, etc.) to manage and inspect your infrastructure.
