# MAVEN 

Maven, Gradle, Ant --- Build tools developed by Apache Group.

In DevOps life cycle, we use Maven as a Build Tool 

### Maven

Maven is Popular and Open-Source Build Tool.

Maven is Automation of Project Management Tool and it is developed by Apache foundation.

Maven is based on POM.XML file.

*	POM – Project Object Model 

*	XML – Extensible Markup Language 

*	POM.XML is consists

    * Meta-data – Data about the data 
    * Dependencies – Like java, python.
    *	Kind of Output – Output 
    *	Kind of Project – Projects 
    *	Description 
   
Maven is Build Tool and Manage Dependencies (Used to add the dependencies to our app)

Maven is used to Build, Publish and Deploy several projects at a time for better project management.

Maven can build any no. of projects. Once we build the code, depend up on the code we get JAR/WAR/EAR files.

*	.jar – java archive file – If the code is in Java, Spring Boot.

*	.war – web archive file – Html, CSS, JS.

*	.ear – enterprise archive file – J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition)

Maven is written in Java and It was initially released on 13 July 2004.

Maven is used mostly for Java-Based Projects. (90%)

Maven helps in getting the right jar files for each project. For each project, it will separate packages for the different versions.

Maven can create initial Project folder structure.

Maven can download required Project dependencies. Visit mvnrepository.com

*	Dependencies – Refers to the java libraries that are needed for the project.

*	Repositories – Refers to the directories of packaged jar files. (Local, Central, Remote)

*	Build Tools: 
    *	Maven: Java, C#, Ruby, Scala.
    *	Gradle / Ant: Java 
    *	Nant: .Net  
    *	Py-Builder: Python
     
### Build Tool

Build tool is used to Setup everything. Which is required to run your java code. This can be applied to your entire java project.

Build tool generates the code, compile the code and packaging the code to a jar file.

POM refers the XML file that have all info regarding project and configuration details.

MAIN configuration file is in POM.XML

POM.XML file has description of project details regarding version and config management.

XML file is in the Project Home Directory.

*Note – One project consists of one workspace, each workspace consists of one POM.XML file.

### Java Project Structure

* Source code – Developers write the code

* Test the code – Testing the source code 

*	Project structure – We can check project files and folders (Asserts, Directories, Resources)

*	Dependencies/Libraries – Adding dependencies for our project 

*	Configuration – we need to configure 

*	Run task 

*	Reporting – if we get any error, we will report.

### Advantages Of Maven / Problem Without Maven 

Adding set of jars in each project - Before maven we need to add jar/war files individually but after maven, once we build the code automatically generates war/jar files 

Creating the right project structure - Before maven, we must create the right project structure. But maven will automatically create files & different versions for each project.

Building and deploying the project 


### Q) What We Can Do Using Maven ?

We can create initial project folder structure using Maven.

We can download project dependencies using Maven.

We can compile the source code into byte code using Maven.

We can package Java project as jar/war file using Maven
