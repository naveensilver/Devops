The format you provided is commonly referred to as **Markdown**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, designed to be easy to write and read. It's often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

Here are some key features of Markdown:

1. **Headings**: Use `#`, `##`, `###`, etc., to create headings of different levels.
2. **Lists**: Use `*`, `-`, or `+` for unordered lists, and numbers followed by a period for ordered lists.
3. **Emphasis**: Use `*` or `_` for italics, and `**` or `__` for bold.
4. **Code Blocks**: Use backticks (\`) for inline code and triple backticks for block code.
5. **Links**: Use `[text](url)` to create links.
6. **Images**: Use `![alt text](url)` to embed images.
7. **Blockquotes**: Use `>` to create blockquotes.

Markdown is widely supported across many platforms, including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and various content management systems (CMS), making it a versatile and popular choice for documentation and writing content on the web.
